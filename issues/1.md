### Title
Migrate Tool Calling Protocol to UTCP

### Body
The current tool calling implementation relies on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This issue proposes migrating to the [Universal Tool Calling Protocol (UTCP)](https://github.com/universal-tool-calling-protocol) to enhance interoperability and standardization.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Research UTCP specification and integration requirements.
- [ ] Refactor `mcp/agent.py` and `mcp/client.py` to support UTCP.
- [ ] Update configuration schemas in `mcp/client_config.json`.
- [ ] Verify tool discovery and execution with the new protocol.

**Note**: File paths updated from `mcp/` to `mcp_gateway/` due to namespace collision resolution. The directory was renamed to avoid conflicts with the pip-installed `mcp` package. Current tasks should reference `mcp_gateway/` paths.
