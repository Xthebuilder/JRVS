# AI Tools for Teams That Can't Use ChatGPT

**JRVS provides ChatGPT-like interface for your own local AI models. Keep data on-premise. Stay compliant. Full control.**

---

## The Problem

Your team needs AI capabilities but ChatGPT violates data privacy policies:
- **HIPAA** compliance required for healthcare data
- **SOC2** audit requirements prevent external APIs
- **GDPR** mandates data residency in EU
- **Internal security** policies prohibit cloud AI services
- **Client confidentiality** agreements restrict third-party processing

**You need AI tooling that works within your compliance framework.**

---

## The Solution

Deploy JRVS on your infrastructure. **No data leaves your servers.** Use any models. Full compliance.

JRVS is backend-agnostic AI interface that connects to your own local AI models (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, etc.). Your team gets ChatGPT-like capabilities while you maintain complete control over data, models, and infrastructure.
